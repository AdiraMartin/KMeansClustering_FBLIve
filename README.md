This Repository is a work progress of my KMeans Assignment



Based on the provided data, 'cluster 0' has lower values across all parameters compared to 'cluster 1'. In this context, 'cluster 1' can be considered as a group with significantly higher social media activity compared to 'cluster 0'. Specifically, individuals in 'cluster 1' exhibit significantly higher numbers of reactions, comments, and shares compared to 'cluster 0'.

Considering an influencer as an individual who has a significant impact on social media, it can be inferred that individuals in 'cluster 1' are more likely to be influencers due to their high interactions and activities on social media platforms. Conversely, 'cluster 0' likely consists of individuals with lower impact or fewer interactions on social media platforms, thus may not fall into the category of influencers.
